# Fb Acceptance tests

This is a repo that run all of our acceptance tests.

## Clone

    $ git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/fb-acceptance-tests.git

Install dependencies with:

    $ bundle

### Setup all containers

The following command will spin up all form builder platform containers and
services. It takes approximatelly 13 minutes:

    $ make setup

### Run the tests

After all containers are setup, you can run the tests:

    $ make spec

### Setup the tests to run to point to the test environment

    $ make setup-ci && make spec-ci

Emails in CI tests are sent to fb-acceptance-tests@digital.justice.gov.uk.

The following environment variables need to be set in order to authorize against the Google Gmail API:

- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN
- GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN

Credentials for interacting with the Gmail API may need refreshing every now and then. Follow instructions on how to do this in the runbook.

The tests run against forms published to the `test-dev` environment. Currently these are:

Features:

- acceptance-tests-conditional-steps
- acceptance-tests-email-output
- acceptance-tests-json-output
- acceptance-tests-maintenance-mode

There will also be a save and return service to test against but it is not currently published

Components:

- acceptance-tests-autocomplete
- acceptance-tests-checkboxes
- acceptance-tests-conditional-with-upload
- acceptance-tests-date
- acceptance-tests-email-component-form
- acceptance-tests-exit-page
- acceptance-tests-fieldset
- acceptance-tests-number
- acceptance-tests-radios
- acceptance-tests-select
- acceptance-tests-text
- acceptance-tests-textarea
- acceptance-tests-upload

Tests for the JSON output are run against the acceptance-tests-json-output form which sends a encrypted JSON payload the fb-base-adapter. This decrypts it and makes it available to be checked.

## Glossary

The acceptance tests uses a glossary of terms:

1. Platform
2. Services

### Platform

The following are the apps that we have on our platform:

1. Submitter
2. Filestore
3. Datastore
4. Service token cache
5. Pdf generator

### Services

The services layer contain N forms with the Runner booting up them.

### Update a specific container

The following command will just rebuild the container:

    $ ./bin/platform --submitter

Or in case of the services:

    $ make services-refresh

## Local

There are times when we made a change and we want to test against our changes.

The following command will install a copy local submitter from your '..' directory,
so please make sure the path is right before running the command:

    $ ls ../fb-submitter # you should have submitter code here
    $ make submitter-local

## Remote

The following command will install a copy of submitter from github and
rebuild the container:

    $ make submitter

This applies for all other containers in the platform (e.g make filestore, etc).

## Configuration file

There is a configuration file which contain information about where to locate
what repos to clone and the container names to build.
This is done automagically but for more details see
integration/config_file.rb.sample.

## Output recorder

There is a script that shows the amount of emails or json requests
send by the submitter, which the output recorder did record. You can run:

    $ ./integration/bin/output-recorder

## Submitter failed jobs

There is a script that shows the amount of jobs that failed to process during
the tests. The tests will output this but you can also run if you like:

    $ ./integration/bin/submitter-failed-jobs

## Updating the tests and running them

Every time you change a spec file you need to run this in order for the
container to be updated:

    $ make integration-refresh && docker-compose run integration bundle exec rspec spec
